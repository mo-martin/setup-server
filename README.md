#Instructions to install vagrant server
Open Terminal

Type 'git clone https://github.com/mo-martin/setup-server.git' in to a folder of your choice 

Navigate to that folder using 'cd <directory>'

Type 'vagrant up'

The app, api and database server will now boot up.

Now create an app and api folder in the same directory as the newly cloned 'server-setup' git repo. All development can now be made locally in the relevant folder 

This is now setup for you to work locally.
